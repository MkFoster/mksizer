# mksizer

Resize images from a source folder and output to a given destination folder.  The source files are not altered.  Takes a reduction divisor to determine output size.  I.e. reduce by 8x.

This is for me to practice with promises and get the hang of Visual Studio Code.

## Install
git clone https://github.com/MkFoster/mksizer.git

## Usage
From the command line:

node index.js imageSourceFolder resizedImageDestinationFolder reductionFactor

I.e. "node index.js testimages output 8"
